Material interfaces embedded in the meshes of computational data sets are often a
source of error for simplification algorithms because they represent 
discontinuities in the scalar or vector field over a cell. 
By representing material interfaces explicitly in a data
simplification process, we are able to provide separate field 
representations for each material over a single cell. 
Our algorithm uses a multiresolution tetrahedral mesh supporting
fast coarsening and refinement capabilities; error bounds for feature preservation; 
explicit representation of discontinuities within cells; and separate field representations for
each material within a cell. 
The image on the right shows the reconstruction
of the density fields for a numerical simulation where a hypersonic projectile
is entering a block of material. There are three material interfaces and by representing them
explicitly in the simplification process we can accurately reconstruct
the density field at the boundaries.

A material interface defines the boundary between two distinct materials. 
Field representations across a material interface are often discontinuous. 
Thus, an interface can introduce a large amount of error to cells that cross it. 
Instead of refining an approximation substantially in the neighborhood of an interface, 
the discontinuity in the field is better
represented by explicitly representing the surface of discontinuity in each cell. 
Once the discontinuity is represented, two separate functions are used to describe the dependent
field variables on either side of the discontinuity. 
<p/>
The image below shows a triangle with 
three materials, the interfaces between them, and our approximations of the interfaces.
A material interface is represented as the zero set of a signed distance function. 
Each vertex of a triangle (a tetrahedraon in 3D) is assigned a signed
distance value for each of the material interfaces in the tetrahedron. 
For cells(i.e. tetrahedra) with meterial interfaces, 
linear interpolants for each material are constructed by extrapolating <em>Ghost Values</em>
at vertices where materials do not exist.

We have tested our algorithm on a data set resulting from a simulation
of a hypersonic impact between a projectile and a metal block.  The
simulation was based on a logically rectilinear mesh of dimensions 32x32x52.
For each cell, the average density and pressure values are available,
as well as the per-material densities and volume fractions.  The
physical dimensions in x, y, and z directions are [0,12] [0,12] and
[-16,4.8].
