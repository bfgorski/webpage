Material interfaces embedded in the meshes of computational data sets are often a
source of error for simplification algorithms because they represent 
discontinuities in the scalar or vector field over a cell. 
By representing material interfaces explicitly in a data
simplification process, we are able to provide separate field 
representations for each material over a single cell. 
Our algorithm uses a multiresolution tetrahedral mesh supporting
fast coarsening and refinement capabilities; error bounds for feature preservation; 
explicit representation of discontinuities within cells; and separate field representations for
each material within a cell. The image on the right shows the reconstruction
of the density fields for a numerical simulation where a hypersonic projectile
is entering a block of material. There are three material interfaces and by representing them
explicitly in the simplification process we can accurately reconstruct
the density field at the boundaries.

The outline of the tetrahedra used to simplify the dataset are shown along with
the reconstructed function.
Since a large number of tetrahedra have vertices that exist in more that one material
standard linear interpolation reconstructs the density field very poorly.
Our algorithm takes the approach of resampling the original dataset
at the vertices of the tetrahedral mesh versus trying to simplify the
original grid itself.
This allows the same framework to work with a large variety of computational meshes
that do not lie on rectilinear grids.
<p>
A material interface defines the boundary between two distinct materials. 
Field representations across a material interface are often discontinuous. 
Thus, an interface can introduce a large amount of error to cells that cross it. 
Instead of refining an approximation substantially in the neighborhood of an interface, 
the discontinuity in the field is better
represented by explicitly representing the surface of discontinuity in each cell. 
Once the discontinuity is represented, two separate functions are used to describe the dependent
field variables on either side of the discontinuity.

Figure 2 shows a triangle with 
three materials, the interfaces between them, and our approximations of the interfaces.
A material interface is represented as the zero set of a signed distance function. 
Each vertex of a triangle (a tetrahedraon in 3D) is assigned a signed
distance value for each of the material interfaces in the tetrahedron.
