Brush Strokes
</H2> 
To paint on a surface, the concept of a brush stroke similar to that presented by
Gregory et al. [<A
 HREF="node17.html#VR00_45">6</A>] is used. 
A brush stroke is modeled by a series of line segments on the polygons
of the subdivision surface, called <EM>stroke segments</EM>, and a 
<EM>brush</EM> that determines how the surface properties are modified. 
Each segment is confined to a single face in the mesh and represents 
a line in the face's base texture. 
A segment is not a line between two points on the face but rather a line 
between two texture coordinates in the base texture associated with the face. 
This is similar to the approach used by Khodakovsky and Schr&#246;der 
[<A
 HREF="node17.html#SSMA99_203">9</A>] for editing fine underlying features on subdivision surfaces. 
However, instead of modifying geometry around a line segment, we modify surface attributes by
editing the texture map around a line segment according to the different properties of
a currently applied brush.

<P>
Figure <A HREF="#BrushStroke1"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/home/bfgorski/bin/share/lib/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A> shows a brush stroke that spans several triangles.
The brush stroke is broken into six segments marked A-F. 
Each segment is associated with one face. Each face is associated
with one base texture and has separate texture coordinates for its vertices.
A brush stroke is drawn by rasterizing each of its stroke segments in the corresponding 
texture maps and then modifying surrounding texels according to the brush properties.

<P>
When painting in 2D-space, movement vectors on the screen are
translated into 3D movement vectors. 
This is achieved by mapping the start and end points of a mouse movement
on the screen to points on the near plane of the camera.
The process is illustrated in Figure <A HREF="#2Dto3DMovementVector"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/home/bfgorski/bin/share/lib/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>.
Two rays from the camera pass through the points on the near plane
and are intersected with the object being painted.
This yields two points in physical object space that define the movement
vector in 3D space.  

<P>
The movement vector is projected back onto the surface to form the line segments of the brush stroke.
Beginning with the face intersected by the starting ray, the movement vector is projected
into the plane defined by the face to form the stroke segment for that face.  
The next face is found by determining which edge or vertex 
of the face the projected vector intersects. 
The face on the opposite  side of the edge or vertex becomes the next face.
The new movement vector is projected onto this new face, and the process continues until
the length of the movement vector is below a threshold.
