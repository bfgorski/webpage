Introduction</A>

Virtual environments (VEs) have been in use for many years in applications
such as automotive and industrial design as well as advanced training and simulation.
In these applications, VEs help to improve the efficiency of product design processes
and aid in the learning process of new skills.
Modeling applications, such as surface, editing that take advantage of VEs 
can greatly improve the speed and efficiency of the
modeling process by adding an ``extra dimension'' 
making it easier to discern spatial relationships 
between objects and to interact with them.

<P>
Polygon meshes are a standard representation of 3D objects for applications
in geometric modeling, animation, and grid generation. 
Sometimes, it is necessary to give models
a realisitic appearance instead of the standard look produced by smooth shaded polygons.
Surface characteristics can be rendered using procedural shading and texture mapping methods 
to produce surfaces that simulate real-world material such as wood, marble, cloth, or metal.
Another method for altering the  appearance of a surface 
is to have an artist or designer ``paint''
these qualities onto the surface using a brush that applies colors or textures.

Subdivision surfaces have emerged as a powerful tool for surface modeling and editing.  
Lounsbery et al. [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Lounsbery:1997:MAS">13</A>] developed 
multiresolution analysis techniques using wavelets and used them for
surface editing at coarse and fine levels.
These ideas were also developed by Stollnitz et al. [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Stollnitz96-WCGTA">14</A>].
Modeling with subdivision surfaces was explored by Zorin et al. 
[<A
 HREF="node17.html#Zorin:1997:IMM">16</A>], where Loop surfaces [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Loop:1994:GTS">12</A>] and 
Taubin smoothing [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Taubin:1995:SPA">15</A>] are the means to 
perform multi-resolution editing of a polygonal model. 
These techniques allow for interactive
editing of subdivison surfaces on coarse and fine levels.
Subdivision surfaces have also been extended to general design applications
such as computer animation and geometric modeling.
Hoppe et al. [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Hoppe:1994:PSS">8</A>]
developed rules for generating creases, dart, and sharp features
that allow subdivisions surfaces to model a wider range of objects. 
Subdivision surfaces with sharp features were further developed by DeRose et al. 
[<A
 HREF="node17.html#DeRose:1998:SSC">4</A>], where they use subdivision techniques
to generate models used in computer animation.
Biermann et al. [<A
 HREF="node17.html#EVL-2000-47">2</A>], have developed rules for controlling 
normal vectors on interior and boundary areas of surfaces.

<P>
In this paper, a method for painting on subdivision 
surfaces within virtual environments is presented.
Our algorithm first determines a set of texture maps that cover the surface.
Each polygon in the subdivision surface has texture coordinates
that are associated with a texture map. 
Texture maps are referred to as <EM>base textures</EM>.
When a point on the surface is painted, the texture coordinates of the
point are determined, and the base texture corresponding to the polygon is modified
to reflect the color change. 
As a user paints on a surface, the textures are updated
and the painted model is rendered in real time.
The system is integrated into a virtual environment using an immersive workbench
and spatially tracked data gloves for interaction.
A picture of our virtual environment configuration
is shown in Figure <A HREF="#VESHardware"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/home/bfgorski/bin/share/lib/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>.
The application was developed as a plugin for
the VirtualExplorer framework presented in [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Kuester:2001:VirtualExplorer">11</A>].
