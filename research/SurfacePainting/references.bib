                 innovative digital 3D paint program. The system enables
                 industrial designers to paint surface details directly
                 on rough 3D models for the first time. Contextual
                 inquiry into designers' work inspired a real-world
                 metaphor of painting a physical model. This provided
                 the foundation for making 3D tools as natural to use as
                 2D. Familiar 2D digital painting paradigms, such as
                 brushes, layers, and masks, were extended to 3
                 dimensions without adding complexity to the interface.
                 Our informal evaluation sessions have shown that with a
                 cursory introduction, designers who have never seen the
                 interface were able to paint 3D models as easily as
                 they could sketch.",

                 generating smooth free-form surfaces used in CAGD and
                 computer graphics. One of the challenges in the
                 construction of subdivision schemes for arbitrary
                 meshes is to guarantee that the surfaces produced by
                 the algorithm are Ck-continuous. First results in this
                 direction were obtained only recently. In this thesis
                 we derive necessary and sufficient criteria for
                 Ck-continuity that generalize and extend most known
                 conditions. We present a new method for analysis of
                 smoothness of subdivision which allows us to analyze
                 subdivision schemes which do not generate surfaces
                 admitting closed-form parameterization on regular
                 meshes, such as the Butterfly scheme and schemes with
                 modified rules for tagged edges. The theoretical basis
                 for analysis of subdivision that we develop allows us
                 to suggest methods for constructing new subdivision
                 schemes with improved behavior. We present a new
                 interpolating subdivision scheme based on the Butterfly
                 scheme, which generates Ck-continuous surfaces from
                 arbitrary meshes. We describe a multiresolution
                 representation for meshes based on subdivision.
                 Combining subdivision and the smoothing algorithms of
                 Taubin [61] allows us to construct a set of algorithms
                 for interactive multiresolution editing of complex
                 hierarchical meshes of arbitrary topology.",

                 been used in a broad range of applications, including
                 image compression, physical simulation, and numerical
                 analysis. In this article, we present a new class of
                 wavelets, based on subdivision surfaces, that radically
                 extends the class of representable functions. Whereas
                 previous two-dimensional methods were restricted to
                 functions defined on $R^{2}$, the subdivision wavelets
                 developed here may be applied to functions defined on
                 compact surfaces of arbitrary topological type. We
                 envision many applications of this work, including
                 continuous level-of-detail control for graphics
                 rendering, compression of geometric models, and
                 acceleration of global illumination algorithms.
                 Level-of-detail control for spherical domains is
                 illustrated using two examples: shape approximation of
                 a polyhedral model, and color approximation of global
