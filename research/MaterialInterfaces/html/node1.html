Introduction</A>

<P>
Computational physics simulations are generating larger and larger
amounts of data.  They operate on a wide variety of input meshes,
including rectilinear meshes, adaptively refined meshes for Eulerian
hydrodynamics, unstructured meshes for Lagrangian hydrodynamics and
arbitrary Lagrange-Eulerian meshes.  Very often, these data sets
contain special physical features such as material interfaces,
physical boundaries, or thin slices of material that must be preserved
when the field is simplified.  In order to ensure that these features
are preserved, the simplified version of the data set needs to be
constructed using strict <IMG
 WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$L^{\infty}$"> error bounds that prevent small
yet important features from being eliminated.

<P>
Data sets of this type require a simplification algorithm that is
capable of approximating data sets with respect to several
simplification criteria.   The cells in the approximation must satisfy
error bounds with respect to the dependent field variables over each
mesh cell, and to the representation of the discontinuities within
each cell.  In addition, the simplification algorithm must be able to
deal with the wide range of possible input meshes as described above.

<P>
We present an algorithm for generating an approximation of a
computational data set that can be used in place of the original
high-resolution data set generated by the simulation.
Our approximation is a resampling of the original data set that
preserves user-specified as well as characteristic features in the
data set and approximates the dependent field values to within a
specified tolerance.

<P>
The basis for our simplification algorithm is the subdivision of a
tetrahedral mesh as presented by Zhou et al. [<A
 HREF="node14.html#Zhou:1997:MTF">1</A>].  We
generalize their implementation by removing the restriction that the
input data needs to be given on a regular rectilinear mesh consisting
of (2<IMG

 ALT="$^{N}+1$">)x(2<IMG

 ALT="$^{N}+1$">)x(2<IMG
 WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$^{N}+1$">) cells.   Given a data set and
polygonal representations for the material interfaces, our algorithm
constructs an approximation as follows:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Our algorithm starts with the base mesh of 6 tetrahedra and
associates with each one the interface polygons that intersect it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The initial tetrahedral mesh is first subdivided so that the
polygonal surface meshes describing the material interfaces are
approximated within a certain tolerance.  At each subdivision, the
material interface polygons lying partially or entirely in a cell are
associated with the cell's children; approximations for the polygons
in each child cell are constructed, and interface approximation errors
are computed for the two new child cells.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The mesh is further refined to approximate the field of
interest, e.g., density or pressure within a specified tolerance.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
For the cells containing material interfaces, our algorithm computes a
field representation for each material.  This is done by extrapolating
<I>ghost</I> field values for each material at each vertex.  When the
field approximation error for the cell is computed, the separate field
representations, built using these ghost field values, are used to
calculate an error for each distinct material in the cell.  The
decomposition process of a cell that contains multiple materials
consists of these steps:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The signed distance values and ghost values for the new vertex are computed when 
the vertex is created during a split or subdivision operation.  This is done by 
examining those cells that share the edge being split.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The interface representations, i.e., triangle meshes, are associated with the child cells,
and the approximating interfaces representations and their associated errors are computed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The field error for each of the materials is computed, and the maximum value of these errors is the
overall error associated with a cell containing multiple materials.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>
