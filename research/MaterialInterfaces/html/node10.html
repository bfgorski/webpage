Error Metrics</A>
</H1>

<P>
The error metrics employed in our framework are similar to the nested
error bounds used in the ROAM system.  Each cell has two associated
kinds of error values, field errors and material interface errors.  In
order to calculate the field errors for a leaf cell in our tetrahedral
mesh hierarchy, we assume that the original data set can be divided
into <I>native data elements</I>.  Each of these is presumed to have a
well-defined spatial extent and a well-defined representation for each
field of interest over its spatial domain.  The simplest example of a
native data element is just a grid point that holds field values.
Other possibilities are blocks of grid points treated as a unit, cells
with a nonzero volume and a field representation defined over the
entire cell, or blocks of such cells.  Each leaf cell in our
multiresolution mesh maintains links to the native data elements with
which it intersects.  We assume that it is possible to bound the
difference between our representation of a given field over one of our
leaf cells and the representation of the same field over each of the
native data elements with which the given cell intersects.  The error
for the given field in the given cell is then just the maximum of the
errors associated with each of the intersecting native data elements.
Currently, we are dealing only with native data elements that are grid
points of zero volume.

<P>
The field error <IMG

 ALT="$v_0$"> and
<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.gif"
 ALT="$v_1$"> are the vertices of the parent's split edge.  This error is
still a genuine bound on the difference between our representation and
the representation of the original data set.  However, it is looser
than the bound computed directly from the data.  The error computed
from the children has the advantage that the error associated with a
cell bounds not only the deviation from the original representation
but also the deviation from the representation at any intermediate
resolution level.  Consequently, this error is <I>nested</I> or
<I>monotonic</I> in the sense that the error of a child is guaranteed
not to be greater than the error of the parent.  Once the errors of
the leaf cells are computed, the nested bound for all cells higher in
the tree can be computed in time proportional to <IMG

 ALT="$K$">, where <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img29.gif"
 ALT="$K$"> is the
number of leaf cells in the tree.  This can be accomplished by
traversing the tree in a bottom up fashion.

<P>
The material interface error associated with a leaf node is the
maximum value of the errors associated with each of the material
interfaces in the node.  For each material interface, the error is the
maximum value of the errors associated with the vertices constituting
the triangle mesh defining the interface and being inside the cell.
The error of a vertex is the absolute value of the distance between
the vertex and the interface approximation.  The material interface
error of <B>E</B> for a cell guarantees that no point in the original
interface polygon mesh is further from its associated approximation
that a distance of <B>E</B>.  This error metric is an upper bound on
the deviation of the original interfaces from our approximated
interfaces.  A cell that does not contain a material interface is
considered to have an interface error of zero.
