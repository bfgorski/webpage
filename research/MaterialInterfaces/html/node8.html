Motivation</A>
</H2>
Cells that contain material interfaces typically have discontinuities
in the fields defined over them.  For example, the density field over a
cell that contains both steel and nickel is discontinuous exactly
where the two materials meet.  In these situations, it is better to
represent the density field over the cell as two separate fields, one
field for the region containing only the first material and one for
the second material.

<P>
One way to accomplish this is to divide the cell into two distinct
cells at the material interface.  In Figure <A HREF="node9.html#GhostValues">3</A>, the
triangle would be divided into a quadrilateral for material A and a
triangle for material B.  The disadvantages of this method are that it
introduces new cell types into the mesh and that it makes it harder to
have continuous field representations across cells.  Our algorithm
represents the discontinuity by constructing a field representation
for each material in the cell.  Each of the vertices in a cell must
have distinct field values for each material in the cell.  These
extrapolated values are called ghost values.

<P>
For a vertex <B>V</B> that does not reside in material <B>M</B>, we
compute a ghost value for the field associated with material <B>M</B>
at vertex <B>V</B>.  This ghost value is an extrapolation of the field
value for <B>M</B> at <B>V</B>.  The process is illustrated in Figure
<A HREF="node9.html#GhostValues">3</A>.  The known field values are indicated by the solid
circles.  The red circles are the known field values for material A,
and the blue circle is the known field value for material B.  The empty
circles surrounding the filled circles indicate that a ghost value is
needed for that material at the indicated vertex.  Vertices V<IMG

and V<IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$_{1}$"> are in material A, and thus ghost values for material B
must be calculated at their positions.  This is indicated by the empty
blue circles.  Vertex V<IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$_{2}$"> lies in material B, and thus a ghost
value for material A must be calculated at its position.  This is
indicated by the empty red circle.

<P>
As described in Section 1, the ghost value computation is performed 
when the vertex is created during the tetrahedral refinement process.
